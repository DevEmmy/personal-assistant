# personal-assistant
A personal assistant package

This project is one which I decided to create one morning, after reading an article written by a friend of mine. 

Imagine waking up one morning and then being greeted by your personal assistant, which can seamlessly connect across different devices in your home. From you waking up to the sound of good morning “Manuel” and it telling you your schedule for the day and a bunch of other activities for it to assist you with.
The projects’ skeletal structure is written in python, it’s just a simple collection of python script that runs on the local machine as of present
My goal is to create a customizable assistant (package) that can be integrated across different devices and interfaces, from smart watches, homes, cars, mirrors and several others not excluding your laptop and phone while making it customizable for both developers and non-developers (possibly end users).

The goal is to have multiple api endpoints for various devices.

### It's an open source project and open to contributions to make it better.

Currently the program runs efficiently on the local machine. 


## To start the program just clone the program with
''' git
git clone "https://github.com/manny-uncharted/personal-assistant"
